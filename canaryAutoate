authomate aws synthenic canary


ChatGPT said:
Could you clarify what you mean by "authomate AWS synthetic canary"? It sounds like you're trying to automate the creation or management of AWS CloudWatch Synthetics Canaries, which are used to monitor endpoints or APIs.

If that's correct, here‚Äôs a quick guide to automate AWS Synthetics Canary creation using the AWS CLI, CloudFormation, or Terraform:

üõ†Ô∏è Option 1: AWS CLI Automation
You can automate Canary creation with a bash script using AWS CLI:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws synthetics create-canary \
  --name "MyCanary" \
  --code "Handler=pageLoadBlueprint.handler,S3Bucket=my-code-bucket,S3Key=canary-code.zip" \
  --artifact-s3-location "s3://my-artifacts-bucket/" \
  --execution-role-arn "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyCanaryRole" \
  --schedule "Expression=rate(5 minutes),DurationInSeconds=60" \
  --runtime-version "syn-nodejs-puppeteer-3.4" \
  --run-config "TimeoutInSeconds=60" \
  --start-canary
Make sure the code in canary-code.zip has a pageLoadBlueprint.handler or a custom script.

üì¶ Option 2: CloudFormation Example
Here‚Äôs a CloudFormation snippet for automating a Canary setup:

yaml
Copy
Edit
MyCanary:
  Type: AWS::Synthetics::Canary
  Properties:
    Name: "MyCanary"
    Code:
      Handler: "index.handler"
      S3Bucket: "my-canary-code-bucket"
      S3Key: "canary-code.zip"
    ExecutionRoleArn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyCanaryRole"
    ArtifactS3Location: "s3://my-artifacts-bucket/"
    Schedule:
      Expression: "rate(5 minutes)"
      DurationInSeconds: 60
    RunConfig:
      TimeoutInSeconds: 60
    RuntimeVersion: "syn-nodejs-puppeteer-3.4"
    StartCanaryAfterCreation: true
üåø Option 3: Terraform
If you're using Terraform:

hcl
Copy
Edit
resource "aws_synthetics_canary" "example" {
  name                     = "my-canary"
  artifact_s3_location    = "s3://my-artifacts-bucket/"
  execution_role_arn      = aws_iam_role.canary_exec.arn
  handler                 = "index.handler"
  runtime_version         = "syn-nodejs-puppeteer-3.4"
  schedule {
    expression           = "rate(5 minutes)"
    duration_in_seconds = 60
  }
  s3_bucket               = "my-code-bucket"
  s3_key                  = "canary-code.zip"
  start_canary_after_creation = true
}
Would you like help setting this up with Ansible, Terraform, or CloudFormation? Or are you trying to monitor a specific endpoint or API automatically?

To create a canary-code.zip file with Python code for AWS Synthetics, you'll need to implement a Python script that performs actions similar to how a browser or synthetic monitor would interact with a website or service. Here's an example of a basic Python script using Selenium and Puppeteer-like operations (via aws-sdk).

Example Python Code for Canary (index.py):
Set Up:

Install Selenium or Puppeteer to interact with a website.

The example below uses a basic page load test with selenium.

python
Copy
Edit
from time import sleep
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options

def handler(event, context):
    # Configure options for the Chrome browser
    chrome_options = Options()
    chrome_options.add_argument('--headless')  # Run in headless mode (no GUI)
    chrome_options.add_argument('--disable-gpu')

    # Initialize the webdriver
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=chrome_options)

    try:
        # Open the target URL (modify this with the endpoint you want to monitor)
        driver.get("https://example.com")
        
        # Wait for the page to load
        sleep(5)
        
        # Check for an element (modify this as per your test)
        element = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//h1")
        
        if element.is_displayed():
            print("Page loaded successfully!")
        else:
            print("Page not loaded as expected.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {str(e)}")
    finally:
        driver.quit()

Create Canary Code Archive:

Package the code (index.py) and the Chrome WebDriver into a zip file (canary-code.zip).

Steps to Create canary-code.zip:
Install Selenium and ChromeDriver:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install selenium
Download ChromeDriver for the correct version of Chrome you are using.

You may also need to include the chromedriver in the same directory as your index.py.

Package everything into a .zip file:

bash
Copy
Edit
zip -r canary-code.zip index.py chromedriver
Upload the Zip to S3: Once you‚Äôve packaged the code, upload it to your S3 bucket.

bash
Copy
Edit
aws s3 cp canary-code.zip s3://my-code-bucket/canary-code.zip
Notes:
Headless Browser: The script runs a headless browser (no UI). If you're using Selenium, this should be sufficient to run the script in an environment like AWS Synthetics.

Timeout Handling: The sleep(5) is for waiting while the page loads. You can adjust this based on the page load time or use more sophisticated waits, like WebDriverWait.

Would you like me to help with packaging or uploading the code, or if you need a different approach for handling specific interactions with your site, let me know!

Got it! If you're looking to create a Python-based AWS CloudWatch Canary, here‚Äôs a complete example of the Python code you can package into canary-code.zip.

üêç Example Python Canary Script (index.py)
This script uses the syn-python-selenium-1.0 runtime (Python + Selenium):

python
Copy
Edit
# index.py
from aws_synthetics.selenium import synthetics
import logging

# Simple canary to open a URL and verify the title contains a keyword
def handler(event, context):
    url = "https://example.com"
    expected_text = "Example Domain"
    
    def test_site():
        browser = synthetics.get_browser()
        browser.get(url)
        synthetics.take_screenshot("Loaded page", "loaded")
        
        page_title = browser.title
        logging.info(f"Page title: {page_title}")
        
        if expected_text not in page_title:
            raise Exception(f"Expected '{expected_text}' in title, but got '{page_title}'")

    synthetics.execute_lambda_handler(test_site, event, context)
üìÅ Structure of canary-code.zip
Here‚Äôs how the zip should look:

css
Copy
Edit
canary-code.zip
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.py
To create the zip from terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
zip canary-code.zip index.py
üß† Notes
Make sure your IAM Role for the Canary has:

CloudWatchLogsFullAccess

AmazonS3FullAccess (or scoped appropriately)

CloudWatchSyntheticsFullAccess

This works with syn-python-selenium-1.0 runtime. You can check available runtimes with:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws synthetics get-canary-runtimes
Want help deploying this via CLI, Terraform, or another tool? Or do you want to test an API endpoint instead of a website?
