aws kinesis lambda 
ChatGPT said:

It looks like you're interested in using AWS Kinesis with AWS Lambda. These two services work great together for real-time data processing. Here's a quick overview of how they work together and how to set them up:
üöÄ What is AWS Kinesis?

    Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (KDS): Collect, process, and analyze real-time data streams (e.g., logs, events, metrics).

    You write data (records) to a stream, which is made up of shards.

‚ö° What is AWS Lambda?

    Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code in response to events (like new records in a Kinesis stream).

üîó Kinesis + Lambda Integration

How it works:

    Data is pushed to the Kinesis stream.

    Lambda is configured as an event source for that stream.

    When records are added, Lambda automatically picks them up, processes them, and continues polling.

‚úÖ Steps to Set It Up

    Create a Kinesis Stream:

aws kinesis create-stream --stream-name my-stream --shard-count 1

Create a Lambda Function:

    Runtime: Python/Node.js/etc.

    Your function should expect an event like:

    def lambda_handler(event, context):
        for record in event['Records']:
            payload = base64.b64decode(record["kinesis"]["data"])
            print("Decoded payload:", payload)

Add Permissions:

    Ensure the Lambda role has permission to read from Kinesis.

    Example policy:

    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "kinesis:GetRecords",
        "kinesis:GetShardIterator",
        "kinesis:DescribeStream",
        "kinesis:ListStreams"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:kinesis:region:account-id:stream/my-stream"
    }

Connect the Stream to Lambda:

    aws lambda create-event-source-mapping \
      --function-name my-lambda-func \
      --event-source arn:aws:kinesis:region:account-id:stream/my-stream \
      --batch-size 100 \
      --starting-position LATEST

‚öôÔ∏è Additional Tips

    Batch size: Controls how many records Lambda receives per invocation.

    Retry behavior: If your Lambda fails, it will retry (with some backoff).

    Parallelism: Based on number of shards ‚Äî one Lambda instance per shard.

add custom filter to lambda
ChatGPT said:

If you want to add a custom filter to your Lambda function that's triggered by a Kinesis stream, you have a couple of options depending on where and how you want to filter:
üîπ Option 1: Filter at the Lambda Event Source Mapping (via filters)

As of recent AWS updates, Lambda supports event filtering for Kinesis, DynamoDB, and SQS. This lets you specify a filter pattern so that your Lambda is only triggered for specific records ‚Äî without writing any filtering logic in code.
üõ†Ô∏è Example: Filter on a field in the Kinesis record

Assume your records look like this (after base64 decode and JSON parse):

{
  "eventType": "user_signup",
  "userId": "123"
}

‚úÖ You can define a filter like:

aws lambda update-event-source-mapping \
  --uuid <your-mapping-uuid> \
  --filter-criteria '{
    "Filters": [
      {
        "Pattern": "{\"eventType\": [\"user_signup\"]}"
      }
    ]
  }'

To get the uuid, run:

aws lambda list-event-source-mappings --function-name your-lambda-name

üîπ Option 2: Filter Inside the Lambda Function (manual filtering)

If you want more complex logic (e.g., multiple fields, regex, conditions), filter in your function:

import base64
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    for record in event['Records']:
        payload = base64.b64decode(record['kinesis']['data'])
        data = json.loads(payload)

        # Custom filter
        if data.get('eventType') == 'user_signup':
            print("Processing signup:", data)
        else:
            print("Skipping non-signup event.")

üîπ Option 3: Use AWS Lambda Powertools (if Python)

For advanced filtering, logging, and metrics:

pip install aws-lambda-powertools

Then use features like structured logging and custom logic.

Let me know what kind of filtering you're aiming for (e.g., specific value, time window, pattern matching), and I can tailor a full example!

example  aws-lambda-powertools
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! Here's a complete example of how to use AWS Lambda Powertools for Python in a Lambda function that consumes Kinesis Data Stream events, with structured logging, custom filtering, and tracing.
üéØ Goal

We‚Äôll:

    Decode and parse the Kinesis record (JSON).

    Filter events where eventType == 'user_signup'.

    Use Powertools for logging and tracing.

üß± Prerequisites

Install Powertools locally (for testing or packaging):

pip install aws-lambda-powertools

Or add to requirements.txt:

aws-lambda-powertools

üì¶ Lambda Function (Python)

import base64
import json

from aws_lambda_powertools import Logger, Tracer
from aws_lambda_powertools.utilities.typing import LambdaContext

# Initialize Powertools utilities
logger = Logger(service="user-events")
tracer = Tracer(service="user-events")

@tracer.capture_lambda_handler
@logger.inject_lambda_context(log_event=True)
def lambda_handler(event: dict, context: LambdaContext):
    for record in event['Records']:
        try:
            # Decode the base64-encoded Kinesis data
            payload = base64.b64decode(record['kinesis']['data'])
            data = json.loads(payload)

            # Add contextual metadata to logs
            logger.append_keys(user_id=data.get("userId"))

            # Custom filter
            if data.get("eventType") == "user_signup":
                logger.info("Processing user signup", extra={"data": data})
                # Do your processing here...

            else:
                logger.debug("Skipping non-signup event", extra={"eventType": data.get("eventType")})

        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception("Error processing record")
            # Optionally raise to fail the batch and retry

‚úÖ Benefits of Powertools in this Example

    @logger.inject_lambda_context: Automatically logs context + event.

    @tracer.capture_lambda_handler: Automatically adds AWS X-Ray tracing.

    logger.append_keys(...): Adds persistent fields to all logs.

    logger.info/debug/exception: Structured, filterable logs.

üß™ Sample Input from Kinesis

When testing:

{
  "Records": [
    {
      "kinesis": {
        "data": "eyJldmVudFR5cGUiOiAidXNlcl9zaWdudXAiLCAidXNlcklkIjogIjEyMyJ9"
      }
    }
  ]
}

That‚Äôs base64 for:

{"eventType": "user_signup", "userId": "123"}

üõ°Ô∏è Deployment Tip

If using a deployment package or Lambda layer, include aws-lambda-powertools in your build step.

Let me know if you want to expand this with Metrics, Lambda Layers, or SAM/CDK/Terraform deployment.
