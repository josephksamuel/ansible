aws workspace current user Azure Ad password management python automate
ChatGPT said:

To automate password management for AWS WorkSpaces users synchronized with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) using Python, you'll need to manage the following tasks:

    Integrate Azure AD with AWS WorkSpaces to ensure users can authenticate to WorkSpaces.
    Check and manage password expiry in Azure AD for each user.
    Automate password reset in AWS WorkSpaces when necessary.

I'll guide you on how to build a Python automation system that checks for password expiry in Azure AD, and resets the password in AWS WorkSpaces if necessary.
Prerequisites

    Azure AD Setup: Your Azure AD is managing users and is integrated with AWS Directory Service (AD Connector or AWS Managed AD) for WorkSpaces authentication.
    AWS Setup: AWS WorkSpaces must be configured to use the AWS Directory Service (either Microsoft AD or AD Connector).
    IAM Permissions: The AWS IAM user should have permissions to interact with the AWS WorkSpaces API (e.g., workspaces:ResetUserPassword).
    Python Libraries:
        boto3: AWS SDK for Python.
        azure-identity and azure-graphrbac: Libraries to interact with Azure AD.

Steps to Automate Azure AD Password Management for AWS WorkSpaces
1. Install Required Libraries

First, you need to install the necessary Python libraries for both Azure AD and AWS:

pip install boto3 azure-identity azure-graphrbac

2. Set Up Azure AD Client

You will use the Azure SDK to interact with Azure AD. Specifically, we’ll use the azure-identity and azure-graphrbac libraries to authenticate and query Azure AD.

from azure.identity import ClientSecretCredential
from azure.graphrbac import GraphRbacManagementClient
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pytz

# Azure AD Configuration
AZURE_TENANT_ID = 'your-tenant-id'
AZURE_CLIENT_ID = 'your-client-id'
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET = 'your-client-secret'

# AWS WorkSpaces Configuration
AWS_REGION = 'us-east-1'  # Example region
WORKSPACES_DIRECTORY_ID = 'your-workspaces-directory-id'

# Initialize Azure AD Client
azure_credential = ClientSecretCredential(
    AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
)
graph_client = GraphRbacManagementClient(
    azure_credential, AZURE_TENANT_ID
)

# Initialize AWS WorkSpaces Client
workspaces_client = boto3.client('workspaces', region_name=AWS_REGION)

# Function to get Azure AD users
def get_azure_ad_users():
    users = []
    for user in graph_client.users.list():
        users.append(user)
    return users

# Function to check if a user's password is nearing expiry
def check_password_expiry(user):
    # Azure AD might not directly expose password expiry, you may need to calculate this
    # based on user properties or policies.
    # This is an example, and may need to be customized depending on Azure AD setup.
    expiry_time = user.password_last_set + timedelta(days=30)  # Assuming 30 days expiry policy
    if expiry_time < datetime.now(pytz.UTC) + timedelta(days=5):  # Expiring in 5 days or less
        return True
    return False

# Function to reset password in AWS WorkSpaces if it’s expiring
def reset_workspaces_password(user):
    try:
        # Query WorkSpaces to find the corresponding user by username (assuming they match)
        response = workspaces_client.describe_workspaces(
            DirectoryId=WORKSPACES_DIRECTORY_ID
        )
        
        for workspace in response['Workspaces']:
            if workspace['UserName'] == user.user_principal_name:
                print(f"Password is expiring soon for {user.user_principal_name}. Resetting the password.")
                # Reset password for the AWS WorkSpace user
                workspaces_client.reset_user_password(
                    DirectoryId=WORKSPACES_DIRECTORY_ID,
                    UserName=user.user_principal_name
                )
                return
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error resetting password: {e}")

# Main function to automate password check and reset
def main():
    users = get_azure_ad_users()
    
    for user in users:
        if check_password_expiry(user):
            reset_workspaces_password(user)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

Breakdown of the Script:

    Azure AD Integration:
        We use the azure-identity library to authenticate using ClientSecretCredential.
        GraphRbacManagementClient is used to query users from Azure AD.

    Password Expiry Check:
        The script assumes that you have access to the password_last_set property in Azure AD (this might require specific configurations in Azure AD).
        The password expiry is calculated as password_last_set + 30 days (which you can customize based on your Azure AD policy).
        If the password is expiring in the next 5 days, the script proceeds to reset the password in AWS WorkSpaces.

    AWS WorkSpaces Integration:
        The script uses the boto3 library to interact with the AWS WorkSpaces service.
        It uses describe_workspaces() to list the users associated with the given directory and checks if the UserName matches the user_principal_name from Azure AD.
        If the password is expiring soon, the script calls reset_user_password() to reset the password for the user in AWS WorkSpaces.

    Automation:
        The script runs the process of checking for password expiry and resetting passwords in AWS WorkSpaces.

3. Scheduling the Script

You can automate this Python script by scheduling it to run periodically (e.g., every day or every week).

    Linux (Cron job):

    crontab -e
    # Add the following line to run the script every day at midnight
    0 0 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script.py

    Windows (Task Scheduler):
        Open Task Scheduler.
        Create a new task to run the Python script at your preferred interval.

Considerations:

    Password Expiry Attribute: Azure AD does not directly expose a password expiry date for each user in the Graph API. The script above assumes that you are calculating expiry based on a predefined policy (e.g., 30 days after password_last_set). You may need to adjust it based on your environment and the available data.

    AWS Permissions: Ensure that the IAM user or role you are using with boto3 has the necessary permissions to reset passwords in AWS WorkSpaces.

Conclusion:

This Python script automates the process of checking and resetting passwords for users in AWS WorkSpaces, synchronized with Azure AD. You can customize the password expiry logic, notifications, and other parameters based on your organization's requirements.
