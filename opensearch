You want to set up Amazon OpenSearch Service to stream Amazon CloudWatch logs, metrics, and AWS CloudTrail logs. Hereâ€™s an overview of the process:
1. Set Up OpenSearch Domain

    Create an OpenSearch domain in AWS.
    Configure access policies (IAM or fine-grained).
    Enable fine-tuned instance sizing and storage.

2. Configure CloudWatch Logs Streaming

    Create a CloudWatch log group for the logs you want to stream.
    Set up subscriptions using an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.
    Configure Firehose to deliver logs to OpenSearch.

Steps:

    Create a Kinesis Firehose delivery stream.
    Set destination as OpenSearch.
    Choose CloudWatch log group as the source.
    Grant IAM permissions to allow Firehose to read logs.
    Enable data transformation if required (AWS Lambda or other options).
    Start streaming logs.

3. Stream CloudTrail Logs to OpenSearch

    Enable CloudTrail logging if not already set up.
    Create a new CloudWatch log group for CloudTrail.
    Set up Kinesis Firehose to stream CloudTrail logs to OpenSearch.
    Ensure the Firehose IAM role has permissions to access CloudTrail logs.

4. Stream CloudWatch Metrics to OpenSearch

    Option 1: Use Amazon CloudWatch Metric Streams with Firehose.
    Option 2: Use a Lambda function to extract and push metrics manually.

Metric Streams Approach:

    Create a new CloudWatch metric stream.
    Select an AWS-supported format (e.g., JSON).
    Set Firehose as the destination.
    Connect Firehose to OpenSearch.

5. Visualizing Data in OpenSearch

    Use OpenSearch Dashboards to create visualizations.
    Build dashboards for logs, metrics, and CloudTrail insights.
    Set alerts for specific log patterns using OpenSearch queries.

6. Security and Optimization

    Use VPC access for OpenSearch.
    Encrypt logs in transit and at rest.
    Set appropriate IAM roles for Firehose, OpenSearch, and CloudWatch.

Would you like a Terraform or Ansible-based automation for this setup?

    CloudTrail: Logs AWS API activity and sends to CloudWatch.
    Subscription Filter: Sends CloudWatch logs to Firehose.

Next Steps:

    Deploy this CloudFormation stack in AWS.
    Ensure OpenSearch is accessible from Firehose.
    Check OpenSearch Dashboards for logs.
    Set up visualizations for monitoring.
