To establish monitoring and alerting for your centralized-metrics-bucket S3 bucket using AWS CloudFormation, follow these steps:
1. Enable Request Metrics for the S3 Bucket

Amazon S3 can send request metrics to Amazon CloudWatch, providing insights into operations like GET, PUT, and DELETE requests. To enable these metrics, you need to configure a metrics configuration for your bucket.​

CloudFormation Template Snippet:

Resources:
  CentralizedMetricsBucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: centralized-metrics-bucket
      MetricsConfigurations:
        - Id: EntireBucketMetrics
          Prefix: ""  # Applies to all objects in the bucket

This configuration enables CloudWatch request metrics for all objects in the centralized-metrics-bucket. Metrics will be available in CloudWatch under the AWS/S3 namespace. ​

2. Create CloudWatch Alarms for Specific Metrics

Once metrics are enabled, you can set up CloudWatch Alarms to monitor specific conditions and send notifications when thresholds are breached. For example, to create an alarm that triggers if the number of 4xx errors exceeds a certain threshold:​

CloudFormation Template Snippet:

Resources:
  S34xxErrorsAlarm:
    Type: AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm
    Properties:
      AlarmName: S3-4xx-Errors-Alarm
      AlarmDescription: "Alarm when S3 bucket has more than 100 4xx errors in 5 minutes"
      Namespace: AWS/S3
      MetricName: 4xxErrors
      Dimensions:
        - Name: BucketName
          Value: centralized-metrics-bucket
        - Name: FilterId
          Value: EntireBucketMetrics
      Statistic: Sum
      Period: 300
      EvaluationPeriods: 1
      Threshold: 100
      ComparisonOperator: GreaterThanThreshold
      AlarmActions:
        - !Ref AlarmNotificationTopic

In this example, the alarm monitors the 4xxErrors metric for the centralized-metrics-bucket. If the sum of 4xx errors exceeds 100 within a 5-minute period, the alarm triggers and sends a notification to the specified SNS topic. ​

3. Set Up SNS Topic for Notifications

To receive notifications when alarms are triggered, set up an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic and subscribe your email or other endpoints to it.​

CloudFormation Template Snippet:

Resources:
  AlarmNotificationTopic:
    Type: AWS::SNS::Topic
    Properties:
      DisplayName: "S3 Alarm Notifications"
      TopicName: "S3AlarmNotifications"

  AlarmNotificationSubscription:
    Type: AWS::SNS::Subscription
    Properties:
      TopicArn: !Ref AlarmNotificationTopic
      Protocol: email
      Endpoint: your-email@example.com

Replace your-email@example.com with your actual email address. You'll receive a confirmation email to complete the subscription process.​
4. Deploy the CloudFormation Stack

Combine the snippets above into a single CloudFormation template and deploy it using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI. This will set up the S3 bucket with request metrics enabled, create the CloudWatch alarm, and configure the SNS topic for notifications.​

Note: Ensure that your IAM roles have the necessary permissions to create and manage S3 buckets, CloudWatch alarms, and SNS topics.​

By following these steps, you'll have a monitoring and alerting system in place for your centralized-metrics-bucket, allowing you to respond promptly to any significant events or issues.​
