aws cft iam role
ChatGPT said:

An AWS CloudFormation (CFT) template can be used to define an IAM role. Below is an example of how to create an IAM role with a trust policy and attach an inline policy.
Example: Creating an IAM Role with Inline Policy

AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Resources:
  MyIAMRole:
    Type: AWS::IAM::Role
    Properties:
      RoleName: MyIAMRole
      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
        Version: "2012-10-17"
        Statement:
          - Effect: Allow
            Principal:
              Service: ec2.amazonaws.com  # Allow EC2 to assume this role
            Action: sts:AssumeRole
      Policies:
        - PolicyName: MyEC2S3Policy
          PolicyDocument:
            Version: "2012-10-17"
            Statement:
              - Effect: Allow
                Action:
                  - s3:ListBucket
                  - s3:GetObject
                Resource:
                  - arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket
                  - arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*

Outputs:
  IAMRoleARN:
    Description: "The ARN of the IAM role"
    Value: !GetAtt MyIAMRole.Arn

Explanation

    AWS::IAM::Role: Creates an IAM role.

    AssumeRolePolicyDocument: Defines which AWS services (EC2 in this case) can assume the role.

    Policies: Attaches an inline policy that grants S3 access.

    Outputs: Outputs the role ARN.

Do you need this role to be attached to an instance profile for EC2? Let me know if you need modifications! ðŸš€
