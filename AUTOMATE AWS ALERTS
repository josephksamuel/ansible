AUTOMATE AWS ALERTS
ChatGPT said:

Automating AWS alerts can be done using Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Lambda, and SNS (Simple Notification Service). Hereâ€™s how you can set it up:
1. Use CloudWatch Alarms

CloudWatch Alarms monitor AWS metrics (EC2 CPU usage, Lambda errors, S3 bucket activity, etc.) and trigger actions.
Steps to Create an Alarm

    Go to CloudWatch > Alarms > Create Alarm.
    Select a metric (e.g., EC2 CPUUtilization, Lambda Errors, S3 bucket activity).
    Set the threshold and conditions.
    Choose Actions:
        Send a notification via SNS.
        Trigger a Lambda function.
    Name and save the alarm.

2. Send Notifications with SNS

Amazon SNS sends alerts via email, SMS, or to a webhook.
Steps to Set Up SNS

    Go to SNS > Topics > Create Topic.
    Choose Standard or FIFO, enter a name, and create the topic.
    Under Subscriptions, add:
        Email (for notifications).
        Lambda (to automate responses).
        Webhook (for integrations).

3. Automate Responses with Lambda

Lambda can auto-remediate issues when an alert is triggered.
Example: Restart an EC2 instance if CPU is too high

    Create a Lambda function in Python.
    Add an IAM Role with EC2:RebootInstances permission.
    Write a Python script to reboot the instance:

    import boto3

    ec2 = boto3.client("ec2")

    def lambda_handler(event, context):
        instance_id = "i-0abcd1234efgh5678"
        ec2.reboot_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
        return {"message": "Instance reboot triggered"}

    Attach it to the SNS topic.

4. Automate with Ansible

Since you're exploring Ansible, you can also use it to handle alerts.

    Use AWS EventBridge to trigger an Ansible Playbook via AWS Systems Manager (SSM) when an alert occurs.

BOTO3 EXPORT EXISTING ALERTS
ChatGPT said:

You can use Boto3 to export existing CloudWatch alarms. Below is a Python script that retrieves all CloudWatch alarms and exports them to a JSON file.
Install Boto3 (if not installed)

pip install boto3

Python Script to Export CloudWatch Alarms

import boto3
import json

# Initialize CloudWatch client
cloudwatch = boto3.client("cloudwatch")

def get_cloudwatch_alarms():
    alarms = []
    next_token = None

    while True:
        response = cloudwatch.describe_alarms(NextToken=next_token) if next_token else cloudwatch.describe_alarms()
        alarms.extend(response["MetricAlarms"])
        
        next_token = response.get("NextToken")
        if not next_token:
            break

    return alarms

def export_to_json(file_name="cloudwatch_alarms.json"):
    alarms = get_cloudwatch_alarms()
    
    with open(file_name, "w") as f:
        json.dump(alarms, f, indent=4)

    print(f"Exported {len(alarms)} alarms to {file_name}")

# Run export function
export_to_json()

What This Script Does

    Fetches all CloudWatch alarms using pagination.
    Exports alarms to a JSON file (cloudwatch_alarms.json).
    Formats data nicely for readability.

Would you like to filter alarms by name, state, or metric? ðŸš€
