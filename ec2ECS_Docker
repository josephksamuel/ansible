To install and run a Docker image on an **Amazon ECS EC2 instance** (as part of an ECS cluster using the **EC2 launch type**, not Fargate), follow these steps:

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

* You have an **ECS cluster** created with the **EC2 launch type**.
* You have at least one **EC2 instance** registered with the cluster and ECS agent running.
* **IAM role** for ECS EC2 instances (`ecsInstanceRole`) is attached.
* The EC2 instance has **Docker installed** and running.
* The ECS-optimized AMI or Amazon Linux 2 ECS-optimized AMI is preferred (Docker is pre-installed).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Instructions

### **1. SSH into the EC2 instance (optional for manual run/debug)**

```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<your-ec2-instance-public-ip>
```

### **2. (Optional) Check Docker and ECS agent**

```bash
docker info
docker ps
sudo systemctl status ecs
```

If Docker isn't installed, install it:

```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras install docker -y
sudo service docker start
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
```

### **3. Define your Docker container as an ECS Task**

Instead of running Docker manually, **you should define a task definition** and use ECS to manage it.

Here‚Äôs an example task definition for a simple Docker image:

```json
{
  "family": "my-docker-task",
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "my-container",
      "image": "your-docker-image",  // e.g., nginx, your-custom-image
      "memory": 512,
      "cpu": 256,
      "essential": true,
      "portMappings": [
        {
          "containerPort": 80,
          "hostPort": 80
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

You can register this task with:

```bash
aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://task-def.json
```

### **4. Run the task on your EC2-backed ECS cluster**

```bash
aws ecs run-task \
  --cluster your-cluster-name \
  --launch-type EC2 \
  --task-definition my-docker-task
```

This schedules the task to run on one of your EC2 instances in the ECS cluster.

---

## üß™ Optional: Running Docker manually on the instance (not recommended for production)

```bash
docker pull your-docker-image
docker run -d -p 80:80 your-docker-image
```

This works, but **bypasses ECS orchestration**, so ECS won‚Äôt monitor or restart your container.

---

## üß© Notes

* To **monitor logs**, use CloudWatch integration in the task definition.
* If pulling a private image (e.g., from Docker Hub or ECR), configure credentials in the task definition.
* Make sure the **security group** allows access to the needed ports (e.g., 80 or 443).
