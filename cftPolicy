aws cft iam policy
ChatGPT said:

An AWS CloudFormation (CFT) template can be used to define an IAM policy. Below is an example of how you can create an IAM policy using CloudFormation.
Example: Creating an IAM Policy

AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Resources:
  MyIAMPolicy:
    Type: AWS::IAM::Policy
    Properties:
      PolicyName: MyCustomPolicy
      PolicyDocument:
        Version: "2012-10-17"
        Statement:
          - Effect: Allow
            Action:
              - s3:ListBucket
              - s3:GetObject
            Resource:
              - arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket
              - arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*
      Roles:
        - MyIAMRole

  MyIAMRole:
    Type: AWS::IAM::Role
    Properties:
      RoleName: MyIAMRole
      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
        Version: "2012-10-17"
        Statement:
          - Effect: Allow
            Principal:
              Service: ec2.amazonaws.com
            Action: sts:AssumeRole

Explanation

    AWS::IAM::Policy: Defines a new IAM policy.

    PolicyDocument: Defines the permissions.

    Roles: Attaches the policy to an IAM role.

    AWS::IAM::Role: Creates an IAM role with a trust policy allowing EC2 to assume it.

Would you like to attach this policy to a user or group instead of a role? Let me know if you need modifications!
