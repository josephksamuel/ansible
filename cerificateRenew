aws alert certificate expired

If you're receiving an AWS alert about an expired certificate, follow these steps to resolve it:

1. Identify the Expired Certificate
Check AWS Certificate Manager (ACM):

Go to the AWS Console → Certificate Manager (ACM).

Look for certificates marked as "Expired" or "Expiring soon".

If the certificate is managed by ACM and in use by Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), API Gateway, CloudFront, etc., ACM should attempt to renew it automatically. If it failed, check the reason.

Check IAM for Self-Managed Certificates:

If your application is using a self-managed certificate (e.g., for EC2 or OpenSearch), check IAM → Server Certificates.

Check ELB, CloudFront, API Gateway:

If the alert is from an AWS service, check the associated resource (e.g., ALB listener, CloudFront distribution) to confirm the certificate attached to it.

2. Renew the Certificate
If it's an ACM-managed certificate:

AWS will attempt to renew ACM certificates automatically if the DNS validation is still valid.

If renewal failed, verify that the CNAME record for domain validation still exists in your Route 53 (or external DNS provider).

If the CNAME is missing, recreate it from ACM.

If it's a self-managed certificate:

Generate a new certificate using Let’s Encrypt, OpenSSL, or a commercial provider.

Upload it to IAM or ACM (if using ALB, API Gateway, etc.).

Update the service (e.g., ELB, OpenSearch, API Gateway) to use the new certificate.

3. Update the Service with the New Certificate
For EC2 / OpenSearch / Nginx / Apache:

Replace the old certificate and restart the service:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl restart nginx  # or apache2, opensearch, etc.
For ELB / API Gateway / CloudFront:

Attach the new certificate via the AWS Console or CLI.

4. Verify the Certificate
Use OpenSSL to check if the new certificate is in use:

bash
Copy
Edit
openssl s_client -connect yourdomain.com:443 -servername yourdomain.com | openssl x509 -noout -dates
If your browser still shows the old certificate, clear the cache and restart the browser.

If you want to automate the deployment or renewal of SSL/TLS certificates using AWS CloudFormation (CFT), here are some examples:

1. ACM Certificate Request via CloudFormation
If you want to request an ACM certificate and use it for services like ALB, API Gateway, or CloudFront, use this CloudFormation template:

yaml
Copy
Edit
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Resources:
  MyCertificate:
    Type: AWS::CertificateManager::Certificate
    Properties:
      DomainName: "yourdomain.com"
      ValidationMethod: DNS  # Use EMAIL if preferred
      SubjectAlternativeNames:
        - "www.yourdomain.com"
      DomainValidationOptions:
        - DomainName: "yourdomain.com"
          HostedZoneId: "ZXXXXXXXXXXXX"  # Replace with your Route 53 Hosted Zone ID
This will issue a new ACM-managed certificate.

If using Route 53, ACM will create the necessary CNAME records for validation.

2. Attaching an ACM Certificate to an ALB
If you're using an Application Load Balancer (ALB), attach the ACM certificate:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Resources:
  MyLoadBalancer:
    Type: AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer
    Properties:
      Name: "MyALB"
      Scheme: internet-facing
      LoadBalancerAttributes:
        - Key: idle_timeout.timeout_seconds
          Value: '60'
      SecurityGroups:
        - !Ref ALBSecurityGroup
      Subnets:
        - subnet-xxxxx
        - subnet-yyyyy

  MyListener:
    Type: AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::Listener
    Properties:
      LoadBalancerArn: !Ref MyLoadBalancer
      Protocol: HTTPS
      Port: 443
      DefaultActions:
        - Type: forward
          TargetGroupArn: !Ref MyTargetGroup
      Certificates:
        - CertificateArn: !Ref MyCertificate

  MyTargetGroup:
    Type: AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::TargetGroup
    Properties:
      VpcId: "vpc-xxxxxx"
      Port: 80
      Protocol: HTTP
      TargetType: instance
      HealthCheckPath: "/"
This attaches the ACM certificate to the ALB.

The ALB will listen on port 443 (HTTPS).

3. Upload a Custom SSL Certificate to IAM (For EC2 / OpenSearch)
If you need to upload a self-managed certificate (e.g., for OpenSearch or a private API Gateway):

yaml
Copy
Edit
Resources:
  MySSLCertificate:
    Type: AWS::IAM::ServerCertificate
    Properties:
      Path: "/cloudfront/"
      CertificateBody: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        Your Certificate Here
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
      PrivateKey: |
        -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
        Your Private Key Here
        -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
      CertificateChain: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        Your CA Bundle Here
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
Replace certificates with your actual PEM data.

This certificate can be used in OpenSearch, Nginx, or Apache.

4. Automate Certificate Renewal
AWS ACM renews certificates automatically if DNS validation is correct. However, if you're using a self-managed certificate, automate renewal with a Lambda function:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Resources:
  SSLCertRenewalLambda:
    Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
    Properties:
      FunctionName: "RenewSSLCert"
      Runtime: python3.11
      Handler: "lambda_function.lambda_handler"
      Role: !GetAtt LambdaExecutionRole.Arn
      Code:
        ZipFile: |
          import boto3
          def lambda_handler(event, context):
              client = boto3.client('acm')
              response = client.request_certificate(
                  DomainName='yourdomain.com',
                  ValidationMethod='DNS'
              )
              return response
This function requests a new certificate in ACM when triggered.

You can set up an EventBridge rule to run this every 11 months.

5. Verify Certificate Expiry
Use an AWS Systems Manager Run Command or Lambda to check expiry:

bash
Copy
Edit
openssl s_client -connect yourdomain.com:443 -servername yourdomain.com | openssl x509 -noout -dates
Would you like help customizing this for your setup?
