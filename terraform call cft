terraform call cft
ChatGPT said:

If you want Terraform to call a CloudFormation Template (CFT), you can use the aws_cloudformation_stack resource. This allows Terraform to deploy and manage AWS CloudFormation stacks.
Example: Deploy a CloudFormation Template with Terraform

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_cloudformation_stack" "example" {
  name         = "my-cft-stack"
  template_body = file("template.yaml")  # Reference to your CloudFormation template file

  parameters = {
    InstanceType = "t3.micro"
    KeyName      = "my-key"
  }

  capabilities = ["CAPABILITY_IAM"]  # Required if your CFT creates IAM roles/policies
}

output "stack_output" {
  value = aws_cloudformation_stack.example.outputs
}

Steps:

    Save your CloudFormation YAML template as template.yaml.

    Apply Terraform:

    terraform init
    terraform apply -auto-approve

This method ensures that Terraform manages the CloudFormation stack lifecycle, and you can integrate it into your existing Terraform setup.
